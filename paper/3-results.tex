\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
    To validate this new feature, we performed a parameter scan study on a PWR
    pincell using a single depletion zone. Tables \ref{tab:mat-params},
    \ref{tab:fuel-comp}, \ref{tab:clad-comp}, and \ref{tab:water-comp} contain
    the material parameters of our model, and Table \ref{tab:geo-params}
    contains the geometric parameters.  We used the ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data
    library available at \url{openmc.org/official-data-libraries}. We used the
    ENDF/B-VII.1 depletion chain in the PWR spectrum available at
    \url{openmc.org/depletion-chains}.

    We used four differnt time step sizes: 360 seconds, 4 hours, 3 days, and 30
    days. All simulations ran for 10 depletion
    steps.

    We used the \verb.PredictorIntegrator. time stepper, which is analagous to
    the Euler method. Predictor-corrector methods are not useful for transport
    independent depetion. The correction step will utilize the same reaction
    rates as the initial prediction due to the static fluxes and cross sections.
    This means any predictor-corrector method will produce the same numerical
    results as a predictor method but with higher floating-point errors due to
    the increased number of operations \footnote{Preliminary testing with
    predictor-corrector methods confirmed the highter floating point errors,
    however they are marginal in magnitude}.

    We used constant reacton rate Q values multiplied by the reaction rates to
    obtain the normalization factor $f$ (\verb.fission-q. normalization) for all
    cases with a linear power density of 174 W/cm. For each timestep size.
    we ran with three cases:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Transport-coupled depletion
        \item Transport-independent depletion
        \item Transport-independent depletion with microscopic cross sections
            updated after each depletion step (one-group only).
    \end{enumerate}

    The first case is serves as a reference solution we use to estimate the
    error in the solution of the new method. We used 25 inactive and 125 active
    batches, with $10^6$ particles per batch. For transport independent
    depletion, we used three different group structures to test the effect on
    solution accuracy: one group, CASMO-8, and CASMO-40.

    Note that the third case is significantly slower than transport-coupled
    depletion as the cross sections need to be reloaded after each depletion
    step. Due to the cross section discretization that occurs before peforming
    depletion, we do not expect the third case results to converge to the first
    case results in limit of infinite particles, but we would expect it to
    converge in the limit of infinite particles {\it and} energy groups. The
    third case was only run for one-group transport-independent depletion.
    Unless otherwise specified, all results are using 3-day time steps and
    \verb,PredictorIntegrator,. The general trend is that concentration errors
    are smaller for shorter depletion time steps, and larger for longer
    depletion time steps, however there are more complicated dynamics for this
    to be a reliable prediction for each nuclide concentration.

    % actinides error

        sections and 3-day time steps at 3, 12, 21, and 30 days of depletion.}

    \end{figure}

    \begin{figure}[h!tpb]

        \caption{Relative actinide concentration error using constant cross
        sections and 30-day time steps at 30, 120, 210, and 300 days of
        depletion.}
        \label{fig:actinides-error-constant-xs-months}
    \end{figure}

    Figures \ref{fig:actinides-error-constant-xs-days} and
    \ref{fig:actinides-error-updating-xs-days} show the relative error in
    predicted actinide concentration for constant cross sections and updating
    cross sections, respectively, using 3-day time steps. Figures
    \ref{fig:actinides-error-constant-xs-months} and
    \ref{fig:actinides-error-updating-xs-months} show the same respective
    quantities for 30-day time steps. As expected, updating the cross sections
    at each depletion step results in very low predicted nuclide concentration
    errors, on the order of a fraction of a percent. The error trend for
    constant cross sections depends both on the cross section and time step
    size. For example, constant cross sections using a 3-day time step
    underpredicts the \ce{^{241}Pu} concentration, but at longer time steps
    overpredicts the concentration. The overprediction is due due to
    overcalculating the rate of ($n,\gamma$) reactions that occur on
    \ce{^{240}Pu}. Figure \ref{fig:pu240-n-gamma-months} shows this.

    \begin{figure}[htpb]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/pu240-n-gamma-months.pdf}
        \caption{Relative \ce{^{240}Pu} ($n,\gamma$) reaction rate error using
        constant cross sections and 30-day time steps.}
        \label{fig:pu240-n-gamma-months}
    \end{figure}

    The error in \ce{^{241}Pu} concentration propogates to daughter nuclides
    that are related to the amount of \ce{^{241}Pu}, such as isotopes of \ce{Cm}
    and \ce{Am}. We observe a general trend that the less abundant
    nuclides have higher concentration error relative to transport-coupled
    depletion. The less abundant actinides have increased sensitivity to
    variations in production. The more abundant nuclides (\ce{U},
    \ce{^{239}Np}, \ce{^{239}Pu}, \ce{^{240}Pu}) tend to have low concentration
    errors, (5\% or less), whereas the less abundant actinides (isotopes of Am,
    isotopes of Cm, \ce{^{241}Pu}, \ce{^{242}Pu}) tend to have very high (more
    than 10\%) depending on the nuclide of interest.

    Figures \ref{fig:fp-error-constant-xs-days} and
    \ref{fig:fp-error-updating-xs-days} show the relative error in predicted
    fission product concentration using constant cross sections and updating
    cross sections, respectively, using 3-day time steps. Figures
    \ref{fig:fp-error-constant-xs-months} and
    \ref{fig:fp-error-updating-xs-months} show the same respective quantities
    for 30-day time steps. Similar to the actinides, updating the cross sections
    at each time step results in very low predicted nuclide concentration
    errors.  There is a notably lower concentration error across the board for
    many of these fission products compared to the actinides. This is due to th
    low concentration error of error of \ce{^{235}U}, which propogates to the
    fission products. Other actinides with higher concentration errors are
    orders of magnitude less abundant in the fuel than \ce{^{235}U}, so their
    effect on fission product concentration error is proportionaly small.

    Concentration errors for low-abundance nuclides using 30-day timesteps follow
    an interesting trend where there is an initial large negative error
    concentration error that becomes more positive over time. This behavior is due
    to overestimation of nuclide production due to static cross sections and
    fluxes.

    Repeating this analysis for both the CASMO-8 and CASMO-40 multi-group
    strucutres did not yield significant decreases in nuclide concentration
    errors for transport-independent depletion over the one-group case.  Figures
    \ref{fig:actinides-error-casmo8-xs-days} and
    \ref{fig:actinides-error-casmo40-xs-days} show the relative error in
    predicted actinide concentration using the CASMO-8 and CASMO-40 group
    structures, respectively, using 3-day time steps. Figures
    \ref{fig:actinides-error-casmo8-xs-months} and
    \ref{fig:actinides-error-casmo40-xs-months} show the same respective
    quantities for 30-day time steps.  It is possible in more complex models,
    like full reactor depletion, that the multi-group structure will become more
    important.

    The time savings when using \verb.IndependentOperator. are immense. Whereas
    the transport-coupled simulations each took several hours to complete, the
    transport-independent simulations took seconds to minutes to complete!
