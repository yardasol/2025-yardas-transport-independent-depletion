\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}
    In this paper, we introduced a new method for running depletion simulations
    in OpenMC. This method relies on pre-calclated one-group cross sections
    stored in a table. The new method is siginifcantly faster than running a
    transport-coupled depletion simulation, albiet with a penalty to accuracy.
    Better accuracy will be obtained in simulations where the neutron flux
    spectrum will be constant, i.e. in fusion simulations.
    
    The geometry used in this study was a simple PWR pincell. We are unsure how
    the method performs with more complex geometries. Future work could
    focus on exploring this.
     
    Currently, we do not have capabilities to calculate $k_\text{eff}$ using
    \verb.IndependentOperator.. We have looked at a implementing a method
    similar to one in  \cite{LOVECKY2014333}, wherein ... (adapt discussion from
    GH issue)

    Finally, while the current method is limited to using one-group cross
    sections, it would not be too difficult to add support for multi-group cross
    sections. The authors estimate that adding support for multiple energy
    groups may increase the accuracy of depletion simulations using
    \verb.IndependentOperator. compared to transport-coupled simulations,
    expecially for more complex geometries.
