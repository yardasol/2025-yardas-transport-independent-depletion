\section{Introduction}\label{}
    Modeling and simulation codes will play a critical role in licensing
    advanced nuclear reactors. In preparation for advanced nuclear, both the
    \Gls{doene} and the \Gls{nrc} identified several technical gaps in current
    \Gls{mns} tools that are necessary for efficient and effective license
    application reviews \citep{betzler_modeling_2019, usnrc_nonlwr_2020-1}.
    The composition of nuclides in a material subject to irradiation over time
    changes due to the nuclear transmutation and decay reactions taking place.
    This process is commonly known as {\it depletion} or {\it burnup}.  Both
    \Gls{doene} and the \Gls{nrc} have specifically identified depletion to be a
    key modeling feature for advanced nuclear reactors.

    Modeling depletion in nuclear reactors is inherently linked with modeling
    neutron transport. In order to obtain the transmutation reaction rates
    needed for a depletion calculation, one needs to calculate the neutron flux
    by solving the neutron transport equation. Conversely, after every depletion
    calculation, the transport solution will need to be run again due to the
    change in material composition. This process can be very expensive if
    looking at lifetime behavior of reactor designs, as many transport
    simulations are needed and they must be done sequentially.

    Recent projects seek to use state-of-the-art software tools in Monte Carlo
    transport and computational fluid dynamics coupled with heat transfer for
    simulating advanced reactors along with exascale computing hardware to
    overcome this computational challenge~\citep{romano2021nse,merzari2023sc}.
    These methods are very computationally expensive, but deliver high
    confidence in their results. If one component in this tool chain could be
    simplified or sped up, it would greatly reduce the computational cost on and
    economic cost from these exascale machines.

    Depletion capabilities were recently added to OpenMC, an open source,
    community developed MC particle transport code \citep{romano_openmc_2015,
    romano_depletion_2021}. The depletion solver utilizes OpenMC's Python API to
    iteratively run a transport simulation, calculate the reaction rates, and
    update the material composition. In the present work, we describe a new
    method for running depletion calculations without the need to iteratively
    run transport calculations by using precalculated microscopic cross sections
    for each depletion step. At most, only one transport calculation needs to be
    run to generate these cross sections.

    In a reactor depletion calculation, there is a tight coupling between
    neutron transport and depletion because the change in material composition
    can result in changes to the spatial distribution of reaction rates.
    However, for other applications, the coupling between neutron transport and
    depletion is effectively one-way. This is often the case for experimental
    facilities with a neutron source where the source rate is high enough to
    cause activation of materials but not high enough to produce significant
    burnup of materials. Many fusion energy facilities fall into this category.
    For such applications, there is no need to run a fully coupled simulation
    between neutron transport and depletion; instead, a neutron transport
    simulation corresponding to the beginning of irradiation can be carried out
    to determine reaction rates relative to the neutron source rate, and then
    the depletion calculation can be performed using the reaction rates scaled
    by any changes in the neutron source rate over time. For fusion systems,
    these calculations are often carried out with
    FISPACT-II~\citep{sublet2017nds}; see \citet{eade2020nf} for a recent
    example. The capabilities described in this paper have also been utilized
    for a recent study of shutdown dose rate in fusion
    systems~\citep{peterson2024nf}.

    The paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:methods}, we describe
    the methods and algorithms used to calculate reaction rates using the new
    depletion capabilities. In Section \ref{sec:results}, we describe our
    simulation and analyse the results. In Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we
    summarize our results, and discuss some gaps in the current implementation
    of the new feature.
