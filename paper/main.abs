    We have implemented a new method for running depletion simulations in OpenMC
    that enables transport-independent depletion. This feature relies on using
    OpenMC calculate multigroup cross sections and fluxes that are reused at
    every depletion step. These reaction rates determined by the cross sections
    and fluxes are used to deplete materials using the existing algorithms in
    OpenMC's Python API.

    To validate this method, we ran simulations on a simple PWR pincell
    geometry. The new method allows depletion simulations to finish in a matter
    of seconds or minutes. The error for this new method scales with the size of
    the depletion timestep size. For ten 3-day timesteps, fission product errors
    are all under 3\%. Actinide errors range from 10-15\% for \ce{Am} and
    \ce{Cm}, 5-7\% for \ce{Pu} and \ce{Np}, and 2\% and less for \ce{U}. The
    large errors for certain actinides can be attributed to their small
    concentration and difficulty to produce accurately using multi-group cross
    sections.

    Our results demonstrates the potential of this new method with moderate
    accuracy and extrodinary time savings for low and medium fidelity
    simulations.
